Rules
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game in which each player is assigned a piece: 'x' or 'o'. The objective of the game is for a player to competitively align their piece in a contiguous section - along a row or column - or along a diagonal on the game board. In traditional Tic tac Toe, the board has dimensions of 3 x 3. However, in this version, players can configure the board dimensions up to 26 x 26.

Commands
/ttt start [DIM] - Initialize game of tic tac toe. Initializer is 'x' player. Only one game is allowed in a channel at a time. If DIM is set, initialize game with board dimensions of DIM x DIM (1 <= DIM <= 26). Otherwise, DIM defaults to 3.
/ttt display - Display game board.
/ttt move [FILE][RANK] - Place piece at position (FILE, RANK). FILE is one of the lettered columns, while RANK is one of the numbered rows.
/ttt restart [DIM] - End current game ande start new game of tic tac toe. Initializer is 'x' player. Only one game is allowed in a channel at a time. If DIM is set, initialize game with board dimensions of DIM x DIM (1 <= DIM <= 26). Otherwise, DIM defaults to 3. This command behaves identically to '/ttt start' if no game is in progress.
/ttt end - End current game.
